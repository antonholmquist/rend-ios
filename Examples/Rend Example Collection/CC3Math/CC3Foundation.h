/** @mainpage cocos3d API reference
 *
 * @section intro About cocos3d
 *
 * Cocos3d extends cocos2d to add support for full 3D rendering, in combination with
 * normal cocos2d 2D rendering.
 *
 * Rendering of 3D objects is performed within a CC3Layer, which is a specialized cocos2d
 * layer. In your application, you will usually create a customized subclass of CC3Layer,
 * which you add to a CCScene, or other CCLayer, to act as a bridge between the 2D and
 * 3D rendering.
 *
 * The CC3Layer instance holds a reference to an instance of CC3World, which manages the
 * 3D model objects, including loading from 3D model files, such as PowerVR POD files.
 * You will usually create a customized subclass of CC3World to create and manage the
 * objects and dynamics of your 3D world.
