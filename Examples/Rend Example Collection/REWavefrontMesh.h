/* REWavefrontMesh
 
 Contains support only for polygons with edge count 3 (triangels).
 
 This is because opengl es 2.0 draw elments doesn't support polygons with higher edge count.
 Only points, lines and triangels can be drawn.
 
 http://www.khronos.org/opengles/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glDrawElements.xml
 GL_POINTS, GL_LINE_STRIP, GL_LINE_LOOP, GL_LINES, GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, GL_TRIANGLE_FAN, and GL_TRIANGLES
 
 Note: Should probably sse GL_TRIANGELS to draw, (at least if distinct draw mode is not specified)
 
 Design choice: We want to keep the groups and other future parameters seperate. This makes the class more flexible and easier to add stuff later.
 
 Note: All data needed to recreate class is stored in REWavefrontElementComponents. See loadFromElementComponents:
