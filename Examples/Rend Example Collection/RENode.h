/* RENode
 *
 * Question: Should node only be drawables? (And not cameras, lights, fog, etc).
 * They may not have enough things incommon, although it's still a pretty sweet pattern that all things exist in the world, so we'll leave that decision for later
 *
 * ACTIONS: The node doesn't know about it's actions. It just cares about it's properties. And the actions will set these.
 *
 * Transform. Order of which matrixes will be applied:
 * - Node:
 * Rotation
 * Scale
 * Translation
 * - Camera:
 * CameraEye
 * CameraProjection
 * -
 *
 * Coordinate systems: All internal data i RENode should be kept in model coordinates
 *
 *
 * GL STATES (INHERETENCY OR NOT?)
 *
 * All gl states are currently fetched from parent when it's added. It's kind of inherited, but not fully. It's saved lots of traversing and messaging to do it this way instead. This is comething to think about for the future.
